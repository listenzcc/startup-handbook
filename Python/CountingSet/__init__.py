There is a common case when we want a set,
we hope its values are unique.

Additionally, in some case,
we want to count the value's counting by their being-added times,
with the counts, the values can be well sorted.

The origin "set" in python only supports non-repeat value set,
but not counting function.
The project is to provide it.
